with Apache 1.X based servers and may not work with other webservers. To see if
your webserver supports this feature, click on the test link above. If you see
forum's front page, then you can make use of this feature. To make use of this
you will also need to create a new template based on the 'path_info' template
set.

will be displayed on the user info page for that user. The danger of this feature

hostile Javascript that may be present.

registrations. If enabled, then everytime a new user is registred all forum
administrators will recieve a notification via e-mail.
