In order to use the maillist and/or nntp utility you need to make sure
the 1st line in the file points to the path of the PHP 
executable on your system. By default this line is set to
/usr/local/bin/php, if you php binary is else where modify
the #!/usr/local/bin/php with the full path of your php binary.
