*****************************************
*	Installation Instructions	*
*****************************************

1) Copy the install.php script in to a web browseable directory.
	If you do not have safe_mode enabled it is a good idea to place the script in the same directory you intend to
	install the forum to. Otherwise, if you safe_mode is enabled, place the upgrade script in a directory that IS NOT
	the directory where you intend to install the forum.

2) This step applies ONLY to users who's PHP has a memory limit.
	Make sure that the directory the install script is in is either writable by the webserver 
	or that a "fudforum_archive" file exists and is writable by the webserver. The latter 
	applies only to users on servers WITHOUT safe_mode.
	
3) Using your web browser run the install.php script.	

4) The install wizard will then take you through 5 steps at the end of which you will have a working FUDforum installed on your server.

*********************************
*	CVS Instructions	*
*********************************

1) Checkout the latest release of the forum using the command below:
	cvs -z3 -d :pserver:anonymous@asuka.prohost.org:/forum21 checkout fud21_install

2) Mark the files for edit by running:
	cvs -z3 -d :pserver:anonymous@asuka.prohost.org:/forum21 edit fud21_install

3) Enter the fud21_install directory, which was created by the CVS and run:
	php -q create_file_list install 1 >> install.php
   ** If your php was not compiled with zlib support, remove 1 from the above command.

4) Now you have latest working install script, you can now begin the installation process by following
   the installation instructions above.
