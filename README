This package contain all the files required to install FUDforum, uninstall FUDforum
and to upgrade existing forum installations.

Install steps:
--------------

1) Copy "install.php" and "fudforum_archive" to a web browsable directory.
	It is a good idea to place the script in the same directory you intend to
	install the forum to. In the unlikely event that 'safe_mode' is enabled,
	place these files in a directory that IS NOT the directory where you intend 
	to install the forum.

2) Run install.php from your web browser.

3) The install wizard will take you through 5 simple configuration steps.

Detailed instructions are available at http://cvs.prohost.org/index.php/Installation


Upgrade steps:
--------------

1) Copy "upgrade.php" and "fudforum_archive" to your forum's Web Root directory.
	In the unlikely event of 'safe_mode' being enabled, you will need to upload
	these files using the forum's file manager.

2) Run upgrade.php from your web browser.

3) After the upgrade, the consistency checker will be started in a pop-up window.
   If not, you will need to run the consistency checker manually.

Detailed instructions are available at http://cvs.prohost.org/index.php/Installation


Uninstall steps:
----------------

1) Open "uninstall.php" with a text editor and comment out the 2nd line of this script.

2) Copy uninstall.php to your forum's Web Root directory.

3) Run uninstall.php from your web browser.


Command line operations:
------------------------

The above mentioned "install.php", "upgrade.php" and "uninstall.php" scripts can also
run from command line. This will allow automated and mass deployment of the forum
software. Details are available on the wiki.

Enjoy!
