*****************************************

Quick install steps:

1) Copy the install.php script in to a web browseable directory.
	It is a good idea to place the script in the same directory you intend to
	install the forum to. In the unlikely event that 'safe_mode' is enabled,
	place the script in a directory that IS NOT the directory where you intend 
	to install the forum.

2) This step applies ONLY to users who's PHP has a memory limit.
	Make sure that the directory the install script is in is either writable by 
	the webserver or that a "fudforum_archive" file exists and is writable by 
	the webserver. The latter applies only to users on servers WITHOUT safe_mode.
	
3) Using your web browser, run the install.php script.	

4) The install wizard will then take you through 5 simple configuration steps at the 
end of which you will have a working FUDforum installed on your server.

*****************************************
*	Create installer from SVN	*
*****************************************

The below proceduce can be used to create your own install script if you don't want 
to download it from the download site:

1) Checkout the latest release of the forum using the command below:
	svn co https://fudforum.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/fudforum/trunk fudforum

2) Enter the 'fudforum' directory, and make a copy of 'install.php':
	cp install.php install-final.php

3) Append the latest forum files to the copied 'install-final.php' script:
	php -q create_file_list install 1 >> install-final.php
   ** If your php was compiled without zlib (unlikely), remove 1 from the above command.

4) Now you have latest working install script, you can now begin the installation 
process by following the installation instructions above.

*****************************************
*	Uninstall Script		*
*****************************************

1) The FUDforum distribution includes uninstall.php that will remove all files 
in a specified directory, presumably files created by a FUDforum installation. 
Because the installation may have failed the script does not have any 
authentication in it. Which is why it is ABSOLUTELY IMPERATIVE that it is not 
placed inside the web accessible directories.
