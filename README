*****************************************
*	Installation Instructions	*
*****************************************

1) Copy the install.php script in to a web browseable directory.
	If you do not have safe_mode enabled it is a good idea to place the script in the same directory you intend to
	install the forum to. Otherwise, if you safe_mode is enabled, place the upgrade script in a directory that IS NOT
	the directory where you intend to install the forum.
	
2) Using your web browser run the install.php script.	

3) The install wizard will then take you through 5 steps at the end of which you will have a working FUDforum installed on your server.

*********************************
*	CVS Instructions	*
*********************************

1) Checkout the latest release of the forum using the command below:
	cvs -z3 -d :pserver:anonymous@asuka.prohost.org:/forum21 checkout fud21_install

2) Mark the files for edit by running:
	cvs -z3 -d :pserver:anonymous@asuka.prohost.org:/forum21 edit fud21_install

3) Enter the fud2_upgrade directory, which was created by the CVS and run ./create_file_list install >> install.php
	This requires your to have a php cgi binary installed, if it is not found inside /usr/local/bin/php
	modify the create_file_list first line with the full path to the php cgi binary.

4) Now you have latest working install script, you can now begin the installation process by following the installation instructions above.
