*************************************************
*	1.2.8 ->2.X Upgrade Instructions	*
*************************************************

1) If you have safe_mode enabled you will need to upload the oldfrm_upgrade.php script using the forum's 
   file manager in to the forum's WWW_SERVER_ROOT directory. 
   Otherwise copy the oldfrm_upgrade.php file in to that directory manually.

2) Using your web browser run the oldfrm_upgrade.php script.

3) Once it runs you will need to run the consistency checker, which normally will be automatically 
   started in a new windows via JavaScript.

4) After the consistency checker runs you should be running the new version of FUDforum.

**NOTE**
	For the runtime of the upgrade script 10-20 seconds your forum will be disabled to prevent data corruption.

*********************************
*	CVS Instructions	*
*********************************

1) Checkout the latest release of the forum using the command below:
	cvs -z3 -d :pserver:anonymous@asuka.prohost.org:/forum2 checkout fud2_old_upgrade

2) Mark the files for edit by running:
	cvs -z3 -d :pserver:anonymous@asuka.prohost.org:/forum2 edit fud2_old_upgrade

3) Enter the fud2_old_upgrade directory, which was created by the CVS and run 
	./create_file_list install >> oldfrm_upgrade.php
	This requires your to have a php cgi binary installed, if it is not found inside /usr/local/bin/php
	modify the create_file_list first line with the full path to the php cgi binary.

4) Now you have latest working upgrade script, you can now begin the upgrade process 
   by following the upgrade instructions above.
