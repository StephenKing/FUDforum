*********************************
*	Upgrade Instructions	*
*********************************

1) If you have safe_mode enabled you will need to upload the upgrade.php script using the forum's file manager in to the forum's
   WWW_SERVER_ROOT directory. Otherwise copy the upgrade.php file in to that directory manually.

2) This step applies ONLY to users who's PHP has a memory limit.
	Make sure that the directory the upgrade script is in is either writable by the webserver or 
	that a "fudforum_archive" file exists and is writable by the webserver. The latter applies 
	only to users on servers WITHOUT safe_mode.

3) Using your web browser run the upgrade.php script.

4) Once it runs you will need to run the consistency checker, which normally will be automatically started in a new windows via
   JavaScript.

5) After the consistency checker runs you should be running the new version of FUDforum.

**NOTE**
	For the runtime of the upgrade script 10-20 seconds your forum will be disabled to prevent data corruption.

*********************************
*	CVS Instructions	*
*********************************

1) Checkout the latest release of the forum using the command below:
	cvs -z3 -d :pserver:anonymous@asuka.prohost.org:/forum21 checkout fud21_upgrade

2) Mark the files for edit by running:
	cvs -z3 -d :pserver:anonymous@asuka.prohost.org:/forum21 edit fud21_upgrade

3) Enter the fud21_upgrade directory, which was created by the CVS and run:
	php -q create_file_list install 1 >> upgrade.php
   ** If your php was not compiled with zlib support, remove 1 from the above command.

4) Now you have latest working upgrade script, you can now begin the upgrade process by following the upgrade instructions above.

*****************************************
*	Uninstall Script		*
*****************************************

1) FUDforum distribution includes uninstall.php that will remove all files in a specified directory, 
presumably files created by a FUDforum installation. Because the installation may have failed the script
does not have any authentication in it. Which is why it is ABSOLUTELY IMPERATIVE that it is not placed inside
the web accessible directories.
