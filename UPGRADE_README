*********************************
*	Upgrade Instructions	*
*********************************

1) If you have safe_mode enabled you will need to upload the upgrade.php script using the forum's file manager in to the forum's
   WWW_SERVER_ROOT directory. Otherwise copy the upgrade.php file in to that directory manually.

2) Using your web browser run the upgrade.php script.

3) Once it runs you will need to run the consistency checker, which normally will be automatically started in a new windows via
   JavaScript.

4) After the consistency checker runs you should be running the new version of FUDforum.

**NOTE**
	For the runtime of the upgrade script 10-20 seconds your forum will be disabled to prevent data corruption.

*********************************
*	CVS Instructions	*
*********************************

1) Checkout the latest release of the forum using the command below:
	cvs -z3 -d :pserver:anonymous@asuka.prohost.org:/forum21 checkout fud21_upgrade

2) Mark the files for edit by running:
	cvs -z3 -d :pserver:anonymous@asuka.prohost.org:/forum21 edit fud21_upgrade

3) Enter the fud21_upgrade directory, which was created by the CVS and run:
	php create_file_list install 1 >> upgrade.php
   ** If your php was not compiled with zlib support, remove 1 from the above command.

4) Now you have latest working upgrade script, you can now begin the upgrade process by following the upgrade instructions above.
