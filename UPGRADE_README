*********************************
*	Upgrade instructions	*
*********************************

Quick upgrade steps:

1) Copy the upgrade.php file to your forum's WWW_SERVER_ROOT directory. In the unlikely event of 'safe_mode' being enabled, you will need to upload the upgrade.php script using the forum's file manager.

2) This step applies ONLY to users who's PHP has a memory limit.
	Make sure that the directory the upgrade script is in is either writable by the webserver or 
	that a "fudforum_archive" file exists and is writable by the webserver. The latter applies 
	only to users on servers WITHOUT safe_mode.

3) Using your web browser run the upgrade.php script.

4) Once it runs you will need to run the consistency checker, which normally will be automatically started in a new windows via
   JavaScript.

5) After the consistency checker runs you should be running the new version of FUDforum.

**NOTE**
	For the runtime of the upgrade script (10-20 seconds) your forum will be disabled to prevent data corruption.

*****************************************
*	Create upgrade script from SVN	*
*****************************************

The below procedure can be used to create your own upgrade script if you don't want 
to download it from the download site:

1) Checkout the latest release of the forum using the command below:
	svn co https://fudforum.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/fudforum/trunk fudforum

2) Enter the 'fudforum' directory, and make a copy of 'upgrade.php':
	cp upgrade.php upgrade-final.php

3) Append the latest forum files to the copied 'upgrade-final.php' script:
	php -q create_file_list install 1 >> upgrade-final.php
   ** If your php was compiled without zlib (unlikely), remove 1 from the above command.

4) Now you have latest working upgrade script, you can now begin the upgrade process by following the upgrade instructions above.

*****************************************
*	Uninstall Script		*
*****************************************

1) FUDforum distribution includes uninstall.php that will remove all files in a specified directory, 
presumably files created by a FUDforum installation. Because the installation may have failed the script
does not have any authentication in it. Which is why it is ABSOLUTELY IMPERATIVE that it is not placed inside
the web accessible directories.
