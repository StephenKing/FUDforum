			Security is an often overlooked feature in many web based applications and as the result many 
			of those applications have large security holes that even the most incompetent of hackers can exploit
			and cause a great deal damage and annoyance.
		</p><p>
			We've taken the time to ensure that the default installation of the FUDforum 2 offers the greatest possible
			security given the available tools, to ensure that should your web server be reasonably secure it would be
			very difficult if not impossible for a curious user or even a hacker to access your sensitive data.
		</p><p>
			To accomplish this task, FUDforum 2 by default will store your files with the most minimalistic permissions
			possible (0600 for files and 0700 for directories), allowing only the user the web server is running on
			to access your files.
			
			</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>
				On servers, which appropriately switch users for each virtual host, like Apache 2 this approach
				is even safer since all your forum's files would be accessible by you and you alone.
				</p></div><p>
		</p><p>
			You may think that allowing web server access to your files is equivalent to allowing anyone to
			access your files. That is simply not the case, on a secure server the administrator would have setup
			an 'open_basedir' PHP limitation that would have restricted php scripts from accessing files in directories
			not owned by a current virtual host, thus preventing people from using PHP to access files of other users.
		</p><p>
			On a properly setup server any programs within the CGI wrapper would not be able to access your
			files as well since they would run as the user who had executed them if a proper suid interface had been
			setup by the server's administrator.
		</p><p>
			So, given a well setup server, even on shared hosting solution your forum's data would be quite secure.
