			Because of the many differences between the 1.X and 2.X series FUDforum, there is a special script
			you need to use to upgrade. This upgrade script will convert from version 1.2.8 to 2.0.2.
			</p><div class="important" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Important</h3><p>
				It is very important that you make sure that your old forum is running version 1.2.8, other
				wise the upgrade script will fail. If you see that your forum is older, you will first need
				to <a href="upgrading.1X.html" title="Upgrading from 1.X to 1.2.8 FUDforum">upgrade to version 1.2.8</a> before continuing to upgrade to 2.0.2.
				
			</p></div><p>
		</p><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="upgrading.1Xto2X.download"></a>Download Upgrade Script</h3></div></div><p>
				This upgrade script is available from the FUDforum's <a href="http://fud.prohost.org/download.php" target="_top"><i>download page</i></a> in 3 
				compression formats: bzip2, gzip and zip.
			</p><p>
				The links to download this script can be found under the 
				'Upgrade from 1.2.8 to FUDforum 2.0.2' sub-heading.
			</p><p>
				Now that you have the upgrade script on your server, decompress it and place it inside your
				forum's main web directory, so that you can access the upgrade script by going to 
				http://you_forum_url/upgrade.php
			</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="upgrading.1Xto2X.running"></a>Running the Upgrade Script</h3></div></div><p>
				Now that the upgrade script has been positioned, open the http://you_forum_url/upgrade.php 
				URL with your web browser, this will begin the execution of the upgrade script.
				The script will output various progress indicators, letting you know of what is it doing
				at the moment. 
				
				</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>
					If you have output buffering enabled or using buffering modules such as mod_gzip you
					may not see any output of the upgrade script until it finishes.
				</p></div><p>
			</p><p>
				Upon the completion of the upgrade script, you will need to run a consistency checker to 
				rebuilt various caches and verify consistency of your forum's data. The upgrade script will
				try to automatically to run the consistency checker by popping up a new window using JavaScript.
				If for some reason such window does not appear click on the 'MUST click here' link, which will
				execute the consistency checker in the current window.
			</p><p>
				Once the consistency checker finishes running, the upgrade process is complete. The only thing
				left to do, is to remove the upgrade.php script you've placed inside the forum's web directory
				in the <a href="upgrading.1Xto2X.html#upgrading.1Xto2X.download" title="Download Upgrade Script">1st step</a>.
			</p><p>
				You should also consider upgrading from 2.0.2 to the later stable release if one is available
				by following instructions in the 
				<a href="upgrading.html#upgrading.2X" title="Upgrading 2.X and 1.9X series FUDforum">Upgrading 2.X and 1.9X series FUDforum</a> section of the manual.
