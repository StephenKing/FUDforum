		<para>
			&FUDforum; is an Open Source web forum released under the &gpl; license that is written in 
			<ulink url="http://www.php.net/"><citetitle>PHP 4</citetitle></ulink> and can be used on virtually any operating system. FUDforum combines an 
			<link linkend="features">extensive feature</link> set while maintaining the ability to generate forum web pages extremely fast.
		</para>
		
		<para>
			One of the most significant FUDforum features is the ease of use, which begins right with <link linkend="installation">installation 
			process</link> where a user is guided through 5 step install wizard. The entire installation process even for novice user may 
			literally take less then a minute from the point of installation to the point a user has a working web forum. Unlink with other 
			installation process' the user does not need to deal with multiple files, all of the forum's data is stored in a single file,
			the install script. The installation script itself is written in PHP so no additional software is required to complete the 
			installation.
		</para>
		
		<para>
			The upgrade process is even easier, after download the upgrade script, the user is only required to enter the location 
			of the FUDforum settings file and submit the form, upgrade script will take care of the rest.
