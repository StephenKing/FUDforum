INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Install FUDforum or identify an exiting installation where the messages must be
   imported into. Note that FUDforum and the origin forum must use the same DB driver.
   For example, if you convert from a forum that runs on MySQL, FUDforum must also use
   MySQL.

2. Download and copy the required conversion script to your forum's WWW_ROOT directory.

3. Open the script with a text editor and review the documentation and setting at the
   top of the script. In most cases you will simply need to modify the value of a single
   variable, which identifies the location of the forum you are converting from.

4. Run the script from a web browser of from the command line (perferred for large forums).

5. Login to the forum and run the Consistency Checker. Note that you will not see any 
   messages or users on the imported forum until you do the consistency check.

If you run into problems, please report them on the support forum at fudforum.org.

Best of luck!
