DESIGN PHILOSOPHY
-----------------

Writing converters is like shooting at a moving target. New forums and forum
versions are released all the time, which will probably break the exiting
converters. As a result it's often necessary to tweak and enhance the converter
for best results.

To make it easier to focus on the mapping of the source forum to FUDforum, we've
separated the conversion rules into "map" files. To add a new converter,
simply add a new *.map file to the "converters/" directory or tweak the rules in
exiting map files.

A map consists of a series of SOURCE_* functions (for example
source_source_load_users). All these functions are optional and a map file only
contain the functions it requires. These functions will retrieve information from
the source forum and map it into an array, witch is then passed back to the 
converter to add to FUDforum. As an example, source_source_load_users() will
make callbacks to target_load_user() to add users to FUDforum.

INSTRUCTIONS:
-------------

1. Install FUDforum or identify an exiting installation where the messages must be
   imported into.

2. Download and copy the conversion script to your forum's WWW_ROOT directory.

3. Run the script from a web browser or from command line (pick one).

3.1. Start the script by navigating to http://your.form.com/forum/convert.php
     Select the source forum type and enter the full path to where it is installed.

3.2. Command line installation is preferred for large forums.
     Example: $ php ./convert.php MyBB ../mybb/
     The first agrument is the source forum type. The second is the path to where
     it is installed.

4. After running the converter, login to the forum and run the Consistency Checker.
   You will not see any messages nor users on the target forum until you do the
   consistency check.

If you run into problems, please report them on the support forum at fudforum.org.

Best of luck!


KNOWN PROBLEMS AND RESTRICTIONS:
--------------------------------

1. The source forum must use MySQL.
   Easy to change, but only MySQL is implemented at this stage.

2. After conversion, login to the forum (not the ACP!).
   The ACP will not invoke authentication plugins and may not allow you to
   log in (first time only).
